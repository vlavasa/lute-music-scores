# lute-music-scores
My own transcriptions or arrangements of various music pieces for lute (and eventually for modern guitar too) in French tablature and/or in modern notation.

The scores are written in software MuseScore, see https://musescore.org

# IMPORTANT
Because I use a Git repository, I use the unpacked MuseScore file format.
In MuseScore 3 it is the mscx format, in MuseScore 4 it is the entire unpacked folder.

THERE IS A BUG IN MUSESCORE 4 WHERE PARTS ARE NOT LOADED IF THERE IS A UNECODE (NON-LATIN1) CHARACTER IN THE UNPACKED FOLDER PATH!
