## Approach
Johann Sebastian Bach’s First Cello Suite has been a lifelong passion of mine. I first encountered this music in early childhood, hearing it played by a cellist who lived next door. Like many guitarists, I later became familiar with the well-known guitar arrangement of the Prélude, and some years ago I arranged the Allemande of this suite for archlute.

As a theorbist, I now feel a strong desire to engage with the entire suite and therefore began work on my own theorbo arrangement.

Shortly after starting this work, I discovered an earlier arrangement by Rob MacKillop, available on IMSLP under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. His edition served as a practical point of departure in the early stages of my work.

My musical conception, however, differs from his approach, particularly in the extensive use of the campanella technique throughout the suite. In this arrangement, I seek to distinguish more clearly between harmonically resonant passages and bass or linear writing, aiming for a more legato, cello-inspired continuity.

Sections that are not yet finalized and still contain Rob MacKillop’s fingering are clearly marked, together with appropriate attribution and licensing information.
